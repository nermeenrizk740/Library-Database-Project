# Library-Database-Project
This project was developed as part of a Computer Science course to design and implement a relational database system for a library. It covers the full process from conceptual modeling to SQL implementation.

## Project Overview
- **EER Diagram**: Designed using enhanced entity-relationship modeling to capture library entities such as books, copies, patrons, authors, and transactions.
- **Relational Schema**: Converted the EER model into relational tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and domain constraints.
- **SQL Implementation**: Created SQL scripts to build tables, enforce constraints, populate data, and perform complex queries.
- **Queries Included**: 
  - Find available book copies
  - Retrieve patron information based on membership and location
  - Identify overdue books and borrowing history
  - Analyze book checkout frequency and author categories
 
## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL database design and querying
- Data integrity enforcement with constraints
- Relational data modeling and schema mapping
- Writing complex SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregation
